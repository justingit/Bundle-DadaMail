=head1 Description

C<Bundle::DadaMail> is a CPAN Bundle of I<optional> CPAN modules used by Dada Mail. 
Dada Mail is a self-hosted mailing list manager and the distribution does include the
CPAN modules that it requires.

The modules listed here are not included for a variety of reasons, 
but mostly because their own dependency chain is very long, or that they
or some dependency that they require needs compilation, or even an outside library.
